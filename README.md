# DermatoLab - AI Skin Disease Detection App

**An intelligent mobile app that helps you check your skin health using your phone's camera.**

Built with Flutter and TensorFlow • Works on Android • Powered by AI

---

## What is this?

DermatoLab is a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to analyze photos of your skin and detect potential skin conditions. Think of it as having a dermatology assistant in your pocket - it's not a replacement for a real doctor, but it can help you understand if you should get something checked out.

The app uses a machine learning model trained on thousands of medical images to identify 7 common skin conditions with pretty good accuracy. It also connects you with nearby dermatologists if you need professional help.

## Why I built this

Skin problems are super common, but lots of people ignore them because they're not sure if it's serious enough to see a doctor. This app gives you a quick first opinion, so you can make better decisions about your health.

Plus, finding a dermatologist can be a pain. The app shows you nearby specialists on a map, with ratings and contact info.

---

## What it can detect

The app can identify these 7 skin conditions:

**Cancer-related:**
- Melanoma - the most dangerous type of skin cancer
- Basal cell carcinoma - most common skin cancer, usually treatable
- Actinic keratoses - pre-cancerous spots

**Non-cancerous:**
- Melanocytic nevi - regular moles
- Benign keratosis - harmless skin growths
- Dermatofibroma - small harmless bumps
- Vascular lesions - blood vessel issues in the skin

The model is about 85-92% accurate overall, which is pretty good for an AI, but definitely not perfect. That's why you should always see a real doctor for anything concerning.

## How it works

**Step 1: Take a photo**
Open the app and point your camera at the skin area you want to check. The app helps you get a good shot by showing you if you're too close, too far, or if the image is blurry.

**Step 2: AI analysis**
The app runs the image through a machine learning model that's been trained on 10,000+ medical images. It takes just a few seconds.

**Step 3: Get results**
You'll see what the AI thinks it is, how confident it is in that assessment, and a risk level (low, moderate, high, or very high).

**Step 4: AI recommendations**
Click "Get AI Analysis" to get personalized advice from GPT-4 about what you should do next, home care tips, and when you should see a doctor.

**Step 5: Find help**
If needed, the app shows you nearby dermatologists on a map with ratings, so you can book an appointment.

## Key features

**Smart camera**
The camera interface helps you take the best possible photo with real-time guidance about distance, lighting, and focus.

**Risk assessment**
Not just "here's what it might be" - the app tells you how serious it could be and what action to take.

**AI chat assistant**
Ask questions and get detailed, personalized recommendations powered by OpenAI's GPT-4.

**Doctor finder**
Find and contact dermatologists near you without leaving the app.

**History tracking**
Save your scans and track changes over time to see if things are getting better or worse.

**Works offline (mostly)**
The disease detection works completely offline. You only need internet for the AI chat and doctor finder features.

## Getting started

**What you need:**
- A computer with Flutter installed
- An Android device or emulator
- About 30 minutes to set everything up

**Quick setup:**

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NadimOvi/DermatoLab-AI_Skin_Analysis.git
cd DermatoLab-AI_Skin_Analysis/dermatolab
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Don't have API keys? Here's where to get them:
- OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (for the AI chat)
- Google Maps: https://console.cloud.google.com (for finding doctors)

4. Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

That's it! The app should launch on your device.

## About the AI model

**How I trained it:**

The model is based on MobileNetV2, which is a popular architecture for mobile apps. I trained it on the HAM10000 dataset - a collection of 10,015 dermatology images from real patients.

The original dataset was very imbalanced (67% of images were just regular moles), so I had to balance it by oversampling the rare conditions. This gave the model a fair chance to learn all 7 conditions properly.

**Training process:**
- Phase 1: 80 epochs with frozen base layers
- Phase 2: 40 more epochs with fine-tuning
- Total time: About 4-5 hours on a GPU
- Final size: 3.15 MB (small enough for phones)

**Performance:**
- Overall accuracy: 85-92%
- Works in real-time on phones
- No internet needed for detection

**Want to train your own model?**

All the training code is in the `dermatolab-training` folder. You'll need:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.10.1
- The HAM10000 dataset (download from Harvard Dataverse)
- A GPU if you don't want to wait forever

Just run `python scripts/train_model.py` and it'll do everything automatically.

## Project structure

Here's how the code is organized:

**dermatolab/** - The main Flutter app
- `lib/screens/` - All the app screens (camera, results, doctor list, etc.)
- `lib/blocs/` - State management using BLoC pattern
- `lib/models/` - Data models for results, diseases, doctors
- `lib/repositories/` - Where the ML model lives and runs
- `lib/utils/` - Helper functions, including the OpenAI integration
- `assets/models/` - The TensorFlow Lite model file

**dermatolab-training/** - ML training pipeline
- `scripts/train_model.py` - Main training script
- `data/` - Where you put the dataset
- `models/` - Saved models and checkpoints
- `results/` - Training graphs and metrics

**docs/** - Documentation and screenshots

It's pretty straightforward. The app follows Flutter best practices with BLoC for state management and a clean separation between UI, logic, and data.

## Common questions

**Is this as good as seeing a real dermatologist?**
No. Not even close. This is meant to help you decide if you should see a doctor, not replace one.

**Does it work offline?**
The disease detection works completely offline. The AI chat and doctor finder need internet.

**What happens to my photos?**
They stay on your device. The app doesn't upload anything to a server. The only data that leaves your phone is when you use the AI chat feature.

**Can I use this on iPhone?**
The code supports iOS, but I haven't fully tested it yet. Android works great though.

**How accurate is it really?**
About 85-92% overall. Some conditions are easier to detect than others. Vascular lesions hit 94% accuracy, while benign keratosis is closer to 78%.

**What if it's wrong?**
That's why the app shows you a confidence score and risk level. If it's only 60% sure, you should definitely see a doctor. Even at 90%, you should still get it checked by a professional.

## Things to know

**Medical disclaimer:**
This app is for educational purposes only. It's not medical advice and it's not a diagnostic tool. If you're worried about something on your skin, see a real doctor. Seriously.

**Privacy:**
The app doesn't collect your data. Photos are processed locally on your device. The only time data leaves your phone is when you use the AI chat (which sends text to OpenAI) or the doctor finder (which uses Google Maps).

**Limitations:**
- Works best on clear, well-lit photos
- Can't detect every skin condition (just these 7)
- Not suitable for emergency situations
- Accuracy varies between different skin types
